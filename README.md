# Moar Ants!

A clicker inspired ant colony management "simulator."


In the future, you will be able to find this project on [itch.io](https://irongremlin.itch.io/moar-ants)


## FAQ

### What is this for?

It's a game. I'm planning on selling it to real people for actual dollar bills, but probably not very many of them.

### What kind of game is it?

It's a very laid-back ant-hill simulator. You click buttons to help your ants decide what tasks to prioritize, you listen to some great music by Kevin MacLeod (see `assets/licenses_and_attributions.txt` or the in-game credits), and watch them do their thing.


### Can I use your or redistribute your assets or code?

Investigations into a more explicitly permissive license are on-going, but for now, please consider the code and assets in this project to be read-only unless otherwise indicated in `assets/licenses_and_attributions.txt`.

Less formally, I am 'cool with' some light copy+pasta and people taking inspiration from my work, I'm not 'cool with' anyone redistributing large portions of my work and claiming it as their own or profiting off of it.


### Why would you put this on github?

Game development is really hard, and I think the world needs more examples of actual projects.

I understand this means anyone could, in theory, come here and build this project and walk away with a copy of my game and never pay me a dime.

I hope asking people not to do this is enough, and I believe the small risk involved to me is worth the small value this adds to the world.

### Do you actually think this pile of hot trash is a good example?

That's debatable but I'm very nearly certain at least one person out there somewhere will find this useful.

### Will you take PRs?

Probably not, as I wouldn't consider it ethical to sell someone else's work without compensating them, and I have no good mechanism to do so.

### Can I give you feedback on this project?

Sure! I would love that! Please feel free to open an issue on this repository.
